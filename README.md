In an era where technology is deeply integrated into every aspect of daily life, 
the banking sector has seen tremendous advancements aimed at improving customer experience and operational efficiency.
One such advancement is the Automated Teller Machine (ATM), which allows users to perform essential banking functions such as withdrawing cash,
depositing funds, and checking account balances without needing to interact with bank staff.
The Java Banking Application with Virtual ATM Machine is a software project developed to emulate the core functionalities of a traditional ATM in a virtual environment.
Designed using the Java programming language and built around the Model-View-Controller (MVC) design pattern, this application offers a realistic
and interactive command-line interface for users to simulate banking transactions.This project not only serves as a practical demonstration of common ATM operations,
but also provides a valuable educational platform for learning software development principles.
It emphasizes key programming concepts such as objectoriented design, modular architecture, and data handling, all within the context of a real-world system. 
By simulating a simplified ATM experience, the application allows students and developers to understand how such systems are built, function, and interact with users.
